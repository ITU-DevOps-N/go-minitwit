# Session 02
## Why we chose Go + gin
We chose Google relatively new programming language Golang for different reasons: 
- It good for developing web apllcaitions 
- It is easy to maintain 
- It is faster than many other programming languages and often compared to C
- Go does not require an interpreter, freeing up power and boosts performance
- Gin is a high-performance Golang framework for creating web application and contains a lot of useful modules
- Gin reduces boilerplate code by providing commonly used functionalities (such as routing, middleware support, rendering, etc.), thus also making it easier to build web applications
- Lastly, there was a personal wish of working with Golang as it a new programming language that no one wihtin the group has worked with before.
